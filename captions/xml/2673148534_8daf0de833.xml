A black dog runs paralell to a wire fence in a grassy medow .
A brown dog is running along a grassy stretch divided by strings .
A dog runs past an empty chair and a tripod , between stretched strings , marking a path through a grassy field .
A dog with all fours up in the air above the clover-filled grass .
The gray dog is running on a green field .
